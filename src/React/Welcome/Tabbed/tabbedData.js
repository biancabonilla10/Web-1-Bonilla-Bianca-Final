        text: '<p><b>Values</b> We invite you to relinquish responsibility and have fun! We are here to do the planning and logistics of the day for you. Your only job is to focus on you. Accomplish the goals that brought you here. Our structured program exists to help you achieve all that you can during your stay. Smile and laugh often. Speak up if you are having any difficulties. Asking for help is not a sign of weakness; it is a sign of strength. Be honest with yourself. Get off the grid and focus on yourself. The world will still be there when you get back. Remove cant and wont from your vocabulary and always give your best. Exercise, sweat, and get a little dirty! The Ranch is a place where style and fashion are secondary to nature, unplugging, and feeling alive. Connect with natural surroudnings. Commit to creating a sacred space, physically and mentally to allow awareness of the present to grow. </p>',
